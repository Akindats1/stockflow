## 💡 Important Notes

### CSS is Live
All table and dashboard CSS is already in production. The styles just need HTML to apply to.

### Reference Code is Safe
The `.tsx` reference files are just documentation. They won't affect your app until you manually copy them into `page.tsx`.

### Auto-Deployment
Any future commits to `main` branch will automatically deploy to Vercel within 1-2 minutes.

### No Breaking Changes
All current functionality remains intact. New designs are opt-in via code integration.
